# Capstone
This is my capstone project for IBM data science certificate

In this project, our goals are to understand what determins the cost of a SPACEX flight and how can a flight become more affordable.

We know that the primary factor in cost is if the first stage of the rocket will land.

In Lab1 - Lab5 I will gather information about SPACEX and create dashboards to observe the findings. 

In Lab6 - Lab8 I will create a mashine learning model using public data to predict if SPACEX will reuse the first stage.

Finally, our result present..

Lab1:Data Collection
  Using pandas libraires to read the file, importing usful libraires into a notebook, loading files into a DF

Lab2:Webscrapping with Wiki
  using BeautifulSoup to extract data off the internet and use or into workable dataframes

Lab3:Data Wrangling
  understand the types of values in the tables we have read to the database, dealing with missing values, dummy variables, and new columns for easier evaluation

Lab4:EDA with SQL
  gaining insites about the data with SQL with grouping data and statistical evaluation

Lab5:EDA & Viz
  plotting data for easier understanding of the important data, using catpolts, barplots and scatter plots
